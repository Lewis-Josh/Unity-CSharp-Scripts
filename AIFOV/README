This Script is designed for testing Random Raycasts in unity.
The original design is for developing a field of view for artificial intelligence, but has other uses and possibilities.
It creates 3000 random Vector3 and adds them to 3 seperate lists (1000 each).
It then itterates through each list and assigns a Gizmo to each vector to make them visible in the editor.
The lists auto populate and auto clear within the editor with no effort from the developer.
The end result is a randomly generated "Cone" that represents the field of view of the object.
The PNG displays this "Cone" from different angles in the Scene view.
